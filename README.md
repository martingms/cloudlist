## TODO

 * Add possibility to make new playlists
 * ~~Fix playback. Doubleclicking a song plays it, also add "playing"
   class to the song in list playing and highlight it somehow.~~
 * Clean up all code, maybe drop flask for such a simple app? Atleast
   clean up the javascript so it is readable etc.
 * ~~Wire up the previous and next buttons,~~ and make the progressbar work.
 * Add a small margin-left to playlistname, to line up with trackname.
 * Actually show a miniature youtube-video in 16:9 when playing from yt
   as source. Click to fullscreen?
 * Add vimeo support.
 * Add regular mp3-support.
 * Consider adding hypem-support?

## Straight up bugs

 * Soundmanager trackids ends up being just 'track\_'.
 * text in input fields has wrong css.
 * URL-input doesnt close after successful add.
